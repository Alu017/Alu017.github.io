            <p class = "text-FAQ"><strong>Water resistance: </strong>what does it mean? We design our bags so that you can be caught out in the rain and not worry about your laptop inside. However, if it's a monsoon, you will want to seek cover for many reasons, including avoiding rain not getting in through your zippers.</p>

            <p class = "text-FAQ"><strong>Laptop size: </strong>Daypack has been designed to fit laptops up to a 15" size. A lot of us use 15" Macbook Pros and we are very happy with it. Also some people on our team use 13" Macbook Airs and are also happy with the size. Daniel the Intern uses a Lenovo Yoga something or other and that's great too - if you're into having a touchscreen on your laptop that is. The maximum area of the laptop 15 Inches high, 10 inches wide. (38cm X 25cm)</p>

            <p class = "text-FAQ"><strong>Where is the material collected from: </strong>The first batch will be collected within 5kms of the coastlines of the Maldives, and the second batch will be collected from the Philippines. Your bag will come with information about where the plastic came from that made your bag.</p>

            <p class = "text-FAQ"><strong>What does the material feel like? </strong>It's surprisingly soft to the touch, yet durable.</p>

            <p class = "text-FAQ"><strong>How much stuff can I fit in it? </strong>It's a similar size to many everyday backpacks: a laptop, a textbook or two, a sweater, powerbank, some cables, and a charger for your laptop will fit no problem. Then there's space on the side for your water bottle on one side, and umbrella on the other.</p>

            <p class = "text-FAQ"><strong>What is Kickstarter? </strong>Kickstarter is not a store. Kickstarter is a way to fund projects with big goals. We are funding this through Kickstarter because we believe there is a huge community around the world that wants to see the oceans healthier. The way it works is this: if you are interested in the campaign, you mark down your pledge today, along with your credit card. You are not charged today. Your credit card is only charged if the campaign is successful, at which point you will be charged by Kickstarter on November 29th.</p>

            <p class = "text-FAQ"><strong>How do I know I will receive my product? </strong>This is our 4th Kickstarter campaign, and reputation is very important to us. We have thousands of backers from all over the world that have believed in us, and we have delivered the products to them. In some instances, goods can't be shipped to certain countries, at which point we will refund any amount paid by you. We're so dedicated to our backers, that last year, our founder Adrian wore leopard print pants every day to prove to our backers that he was doing everything he could to get products to everyone, and he wore them until all bags were received! It took 9 months for all the final bags to be shipped - and he held to his word!</p>

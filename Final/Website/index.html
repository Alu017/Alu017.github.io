    <div class = "text-home"><strong>We believe</strong> that being a global citizen is about being a good steward to the earth while enjoying everything that it has to offer. Our goal is to undo the damage humans have caused to the planet, beginning with ocean plastics. That’s why everything we make is created with a belief in building sustainability for tomorrow. We strive to give more back to the planet than we take.

We’re obsessed with solving problems for our fellow global citizens. We create smart and sustainable everyday items at the intersection of fashion and technology. We make awesome products that are available to you at a price that’s reasonable, because we believe you should spend your money on experiences, not things.</div>
